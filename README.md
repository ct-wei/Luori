## Quick Start
### Preparation
- Import the IP-ASN32-DAT file into the ```Luori/pyasn_data``` folder.(https://archive.routeviews.org/route-views6/bgpdata/)
- Import the seeded data into the ```Luori/routingprefix_dataset``` folder classified by routing prefix.
  
  To avoid folder symbol ```/``` ,please use ```_```.
  For exmaple, use the name of ```2a00:1c50:94::_48.txt```  instead of ```2a00:1c50:94::/48.txt``` as the name of txt file.

### Step1 : Make Pickle File
```bash
python3 pickle_maker.py
```

### Step2 : Set the config
Set the configuration in ```MCTS_Search/config.py```

Enter the active address escape trap threshold in ```trap_n```

Enter the scanning list filename in ```scanninglist```

Enter the FRP filename in ```fullrespond_path```

Enter the log filename in ```logpath```

Enter the generated filename in ```pickle_file```



### Step3 : Run Luori
- For Seeded Routing Prefix
```bash
python3 MCTS_Search/MCTS_seeded_controller.py
```

- For Unseeded Routing Prefix
```bash
python3 MCTS_Search/MCTS_unseeded_controller.py
```
